## Design

### Program

We develop an ARM Assembly program that produces a two-part light show with sound on micro:bit.

- **Pt.1**
  - **Light**
    - Small dots move over the board and transform into a crosshair.
    - Crosshair aims around and expands into spurts, transforming into a windmill.
    - The windmill spins clockwise and then anti-clockwise, ends as a beating heart.
  - **Sound**  
    - Matching the blink of lights, *James Bond Theme* is played.
- **Pt.2**
  - **Light**
    - The *Matrix*-style falling strips replace the *Bond*-style blood drip scene. 
    - Stripe lengths are generated randomly to make the light show ever-changing.
  - **Sound** 
    - A specific byte beat music is played continuously.

### Light

An LED can be enlightened by changing the value of its corresponding pins for the row and the column using the load-twiddle-store pattern [1].

### Sound

- **Pt.1** music consists of various music notes with durations, and each music note corresponds to a specific frequency value [2]. Such frequency values can be used with constant positive/negative amplitude values to produce audible square waves as music.

- **Pt.2** byte beat music derives from arithmetic operations with an incrementing number in an infinite loop [3]. Essentially, it produces an audible sawtooth wave as music. 

### Challenges

- There is no built-in function for a random number generator in ARM Assembly.
- The RNG peripheral on the micro:bit is constrained in a range of 0-255.

### Mathematics

The goal can still be achieved using the linear congruential generator (LCG); the equation is as below [4]

$$ a \cdot seed + c \mod m $$

$$ a = 75, c = 74, m = 2^{16} + 1 $$

Note that the result value generated by LCG is deterministic if the seed is defined. 

We first produce a random value using RNG and then seed that value to LCG to create a truly random number that is not constrained to RNG's range.

## Implementation

### Project structure

```
src
 ┣ main.S      
 ┣ music.S     
 ┣ part-1.S     
 ┣ part-2.S    
 ┗ rand.S      
```

### Control flow

The `main` function first initialises the micro:bit audio function by calling `audio_init`, then plays **Pt.1** and **Pt.2** of the light show in sequence by calling `Pt_1` and `Pt_2`. 

- In `Pt_1`, we pass the input data from memory to `frame_n_music`, where we scan an LED matrix column by column repeatedly and enlighten the rows that should be on by calling a set of `set/clear-DIR/OUT` functions. The duration of this process is adjusted roughly the same as the current music note duration. When it ends, we play the current music note by calling `music_note`.
- In `Pt_2`, we call `generate_next_frame` to generate the next frame of an image by shifting down the current frame and leaving the header row to randomness. Hence, when we call `frame_n_bytebeat`, the strips are random in length and look like falling, while exciting byte beat music is played.

## Analysis

### Validity

Our program imitates classic movies to implement an ever-changing light show with exciting sound effects and some randomness on the micro:bit, which lives up to our goal of an engaging light show.

### Decisions

- We use highly modularised functions with high cohesion and low coupling; hence, they are easy to modify and understand.
- The LED status matrix and music frequency-duration table data are all stored in the `.data` section on memory, which saves lots of register usage.

### Future work

- When playing music notes in **Pt.1**, LED lights are cut off. This can be improved by merging the loops for both light and sound.
- Although the falling strips in **Pt.2** are generative, the byte beat is always in the same loop. The sound can be randomised too.
